# Creating a Telegram Bot

Let's get started!

In this tutorial you'll get a Telegram Bot up and running on your local enviornment. Later you'll also learn how to deploy it to your OpenShift server.

We'll use the Python library provided by Telegram called [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/).

To begin, you'll need a Telegram Access Token for your Bot.

1. Create or sign in to your [Telegram Account](https://web.telegram.org/)

2. Search for `@BotFather`

	![Search for @BotFather](demo/botfather_conversation.png "Search for @BotFather")

3. Initialize a conversation with the `@BotFather`

	![Initialize Conversation with BotFather](demo/botfather_init.png "Initialize Conversation with BotFather")
	
4. Create a new bot by typing `/newbot` and follow the guided process.

	Congratulations, you've created your Telegram Bot :) 

5. Generate an access token which you'll need to communicate with your bot by typing `/token`

6. Replace your Telegram access token in `telegram.py` by `YOUR TOKEN`

7. Fire up a command line and install the `python-telegram-bot` library through your command line by running:

	`pip install python-telegram-bot`

9. To start your bot run `python bot.py` (stop your bot by running CTRL+Z)

10. Your Bot supports the following inputs:
	* /start
	![/start command](demo/botfather_start.png "/start command")
	* /hello
	![/hello command](demo/botfather_hello.png "/hello command")
	* /help
	![/help command](demo/botfather_help.png "/help command")
	* /caps your text
	![Caps text](demo/botfather_caps.png "Caps text")
	* Echoes messages
	![Echo text](demo/botfather_echo.png "Echo text")

### Deploying your bot to OpenShift

Coming soon â€¦

## Notes

Add `@Hello_Telegram_Bot` and send him a message to test the features in this tutorial.

### Examples by `python-telegram-bot`

Get inspired by more [Examples](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/tree/master/examples) here:

**[`echobot2.py`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/examples/echobot2.py)**

This is probably the base for most of the bots made with `python-telegram-bot`. It simply replies to each text message with a message that contains the same text.

**[`timerbot.py`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/examples/timerbot.py)**

This bot uses the [`JobQueue`](https://pythonhosted.org/python-telegram-bot/telegram.ext.jobqueue.html) class to send timed messages. The user sets a timer by using `/set` command with a specific time, for example `/set 30`. The bot then sets up a job to send a message to that user after 30 seconds. The user can also cancel the timer by sending `/unset`. To learn more about the `JobQueue`, read [this wiki article](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Extensions-%E2%80%93-JobQueue).

**[`conversationbot.py`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/examples/conversationbot.py)**

A common task for a bot is to ask information from the user. In v5.0 of this library, we introduced the [`ConversationHandler`](https://pythonhosted.org/python-telegram-bot/telegram.ext.conversationhandler.html) for that exact purpose. This example uses it to retrieve user-information in a conversation-like style.

**[`inlinekeyboard.py`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/examples/inlinekeyboard.py)**

This example sheds some light on inline keyboards, callback queries and message editing.

**[`inlinebot.py`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/examples/inlinebot.py)**

A basic example of an [inline bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots/inline). Don't forget to enable inline mode with [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).
